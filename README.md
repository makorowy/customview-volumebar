# Custom volume bar
This is an example of how to create a custom view by extending a View class. 

There are two versions of it:
1. The first one is a very basic implementation of custom volume bar and it's on _master_ branch. The calculations there are pretty simple and straighforward.

<br/>
2. The second one is also a custom volume bar, but much nicer. You can find it on the _delightful_ branch.

<div align="center"><a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/21wztb"><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/21wztb.gif" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a></div>
